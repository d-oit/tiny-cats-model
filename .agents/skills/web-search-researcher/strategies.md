# Search Strategies

## For API/Library Documentation

- Search official docs first: "[library] official documentation [feature]"
- Look for changelog/release notes for version info
- Find code examples in official repos

**Example**:
```
"Stripe webhook signature verification" official documentation
site:stripe.com webhook signature validation
```

## For Best Practices

- Search for recent articles (include current year)
- Look for content from recognized experts
- Cross-reference multiple sources
- Search both "best practices" and "anti-patterns"

**Example**:
```
"Rust async best practices" [CURRENT_YEAR]
"Tokio performance anti-patterns" [CURRENT_YEAR]
```

## For Technical Solutions

- Use specific error messages in quotes
- Search Stack Overflow for real-world solutions
- Look for GitHub issues and discussions
- Find blog posts with similar implementations

**Example**:
```
"tokio runtime panic" redb write transaction
site:github.com tokio blocking write transaction
```

## For Comparisons

- Search "X vs Y" comparisons
- Look for migration guides
- Find benchmarks and performance comparisons
- Search for decision matrices

**Example**:
```
"redb vs sled" performance comparison
"SQLite vs Turso" migration guide
```
