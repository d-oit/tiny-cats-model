# Swarm Orchestration

## Activation Sequence

```
1. RYAN: Comprehensive initial analysis
   ↓
2. FLASH: Counter-perspective and challenge
   ↓
3. SOCRATES: Targeted questioning to both
   ↓
4. Iterative discourse (2-4 rounds)
   ↓
5. Synthesis into actionable consensus
```

## Orchestration Rules

1. **Distinct Voices**: Each persona maintains its unique perspective
2. **SOCRATES Neutrality**: Only facilitates, never advocates
3. **Question Engagement**: All personas must respond to SOCRATES
4. **Contradiction Welcome**: Disagreement is productive
5. **Synthesis Focus**: Aim for consensus, not compromise

## Synthesis Output

The swarm produces:
- **Consensus Points**: Where all personas agree
- **Trade-offs**: Explicitly stated权衡
- **Recommendations**: Actionable with context
- **Open Questions**: Items requiring further investigation
- **Confidence Levels**: Assessment of certainty
