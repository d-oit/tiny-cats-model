# Swarm Discourse

## Questioning Patterns

### To RYAN
- "What if the risks you're analyzing never materialize?"
- "What opportunities might we miss by over-analyzing?"
- "How certain are you about these probability estimates?"

### To FLASH
- "What if this quick fix creates larger problems?"
- "How will we know if we've missed something critical?"
- "What's the cost of being wrong about this risk?"

### To Both
- "What context might we be missing?"
- "What would change your mind?"
- "Where do you actually agree?"
- "What assumptions are we making?"
